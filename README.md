# Holo-Five-0

Holo-Five-0 is one of the winning HoloLens applications that was built over a period of ~45hours for the Holographic Hackathon on 6/24/2016 with Microsoft HoloLens, Creative Technology Center, and VRLA.

Holo-Five-0 won the Best Spatial Mapping category.

Our goal was to showcase possibilities of interactive crime-scene education/learning for Law Enforcement or Law Students using the HoloLens device. The same could be applied for any other Augmented Reality device (ie. Google Tango) equipped with proper spatial mapping/meshing and tracking capabilities.
